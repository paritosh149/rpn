## Calculator - Reverse Polish Notation
The idea is to build a basic RPN calculator

### Run it on console

```java -jar .\target\rpn-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar```

### Run it on browser (via [CheerpJ](https://leaningtech.com/pages/cheerpj.html))

[https://paritosh149.github.io/rpn/](https://paritosh149.github.io/rpn/)

#### NOTE: **This one requires JRE 8 or above**
